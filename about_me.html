          <li>My favorite author is Simone St. James, her works are a mix of horror, thriller, and romance. If I had to pick a favorite book from her works it would be "The Haunting of Maddy Claire".</li>
          <li>I am also a major nerd for video games, anime, and manga. Currently, more into anime, with my favorite one being "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu No Yaiba". As you can probably guess from the title it is a horror, thriller, and action anime. It is amazing!</li>
          <li>My taste in music is a mix of pop, rap, R&B, and, my favorite, classic country, with Conway Twitty being my favorite. If you have never heard one of his songs, I would recommend listening to "Hello Darlin'". It sounds cheesey, and it is, but it's fun to sing along with.</li>
