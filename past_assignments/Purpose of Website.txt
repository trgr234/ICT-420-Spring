      The purpose of this website is to provide potential employers with background information about myself, future goals and plans, and the achievements I have accomplished. This site completes this by contributing important information about myself throughout the website, having access to my current resume, and allowing them the option of multiple different modes of communication with me. Therefore, the main purpose of the site is to demonstrate to potential/future employers why I would be a good candidate for positions in a professional and concise website for desktops and mobile devices.
